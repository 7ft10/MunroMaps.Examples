<h2>Coaching Engagement Goal</h2>
<p>
    By the end of February 2019, the coach will have facilitated and set each team up the Cyber and Financial squads
    for successful delivery, in which teams constantly delivery great value that is loved by their customers (internal
    and external). This will be achieved by the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Providing context and understanding of the value of basic ceremonies (stand-ups, retrospectives, and
            showcases).</li>
        <li>Assist in setting up and training staff in Jira. Including releases/versions, epic management, and
            iteration planning.</li>
        <li>Work with leadership team members to update roadmaps and encourage a servant leadership role. Servant
            leadership will help empower teams and allow them to provide realistic estimates and high quality work on
            time and within budget.</li>
    </ul>
